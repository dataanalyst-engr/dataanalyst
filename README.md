## 🚀 Portfolio Projects  
Here are some of my key projects:  

- **Project 1: Bike Sharing Demand Prediction App**  
  ![Project 1 Image](assets/img/Rshinpappimg.png)  
  *The data constituted of weather updates, Bike sharing demands of different cities have to be collected from various sources. The data is uncleaned containing missing values, non-numeric , undesired reference links etc. The dataset is needed to go through Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL. After pre-processing Data I have to build a Regression Model and refine that model for Predicting bike-sharing demand w.r.t several important predictors(variables). At last but not least I have to deliver my findings in form of interactive dashboard.*

- **Project 2: Stock Seasonality Equation**  
  ![Project 2 Image](assets/img/CVS.png)  
  *To formulate seasonality equation in python to determine the sell and buy date for assets, past 25 years data of assets has been fetched and preprocessed to build equation that would determine the best buy-sell date and seasonality in the graph. I was in contract with mobyticktrading for this project.*

- **Project 5: Mediation Analysis Using GLM in R**  
  ![Project 2 Image](assets/img/Mediation Analysis.png)  
  *Total effect is negative in our case, which satisfies out hypothesis that direct effect more negatively and significantly decrease the ESTATUS, leading to total effect as negative and significant,though indirect effects through mediators are positive and insignifiacnt.*
